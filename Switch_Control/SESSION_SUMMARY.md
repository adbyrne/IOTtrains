### Session Summary

We collaborated to define and set up a project for an ESP32-based model railroad turnout controller.

1.  **Product Requirements:** We began by creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD). The initial concept of a simple pushbutton controller was updated to a more robust, network-enabled IoT device.
2.  **MQTT & JMRI:** We established that the device will be controlled via MQTT, adhering to JMRI (Java Model Railroad Interface) conventions for interoperability. We researched and defined the specific topic structure (`mqTrains/turnout/[device_id]/state`) and message payloads (`CLOSED`/`THROWN`).
3.  **Configuration:** We specified that all key parameters (WiFi credentials, MQTT settings, servo angles, device ID) will be managed by a configuration function and stored on the device's non-volatile memory.
4.  **File Creation:**
    *   The detailed PRD was saved to `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
    *   After verifying the existing VSCode and PlatformIO configuration, a complete skeleton application was written to `Station_OS/src/main.cpp`, implementing the core logic defined in the PRD.

The result is a well-defined project with a solid foundation in both documentation and starter code.
